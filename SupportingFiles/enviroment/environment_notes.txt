- I now use the gcms10.yml file which should work with any version of Miniconda3
-   has problems with netCDF4

- Environment gcms.yml is now more up to date
- I always have problems installing netCDF4 package. I need to install HDF5 version 1.12.2 with brew.
-     Can then install netCDF4 1.6.0 with pip
