This repository contains the PolyMID suite of software for analyzing metabolite spectral data. Functions include peak integration (AnalyzeSpectra/Integrate.py), spectral visualization (AnalyzeSpectra/PlotCDF.py), and correcting for heavy isotope incorporation (Correct.py). For now, instructions for use are contained in the comments of the .py files (admittedly not the best practice but will be corrected as soon as the NIH comes through with funding to support production code in academic labs).
