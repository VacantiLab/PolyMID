- The peak profile in the library causes match_fingerprint to look for certain peaks to match a group. Document those rules and maybe make them different for the alkanes (i.e. don't allow for labeling).

- the function is now run by running integrate() in integrate.py
- first import AnalyzeSpectra from one directory above this directory
- then AnalyzeSpectra.integrate() can be run


Manual Integration tool
- create an option that will integrate at a given RI range without the condition that a peak is there. The integrate tool is scipy.integrate.simps(y,x) in integrate_peaks.py
